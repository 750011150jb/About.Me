<p> "I am new to coding and have this dream to create video games using codes. I am born in Elkins, West Virginia and have moved around a lot since I was fourteen. I am 20 years old and plan on going to college as soon as possible. I wish to learn as much as I can about coding."
<p> "I need some help with coding and was wondering if anyone would be willing to help me out? It would be much appreciated."</p>
